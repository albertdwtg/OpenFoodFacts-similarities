# OpenFoodFacts-similarities

For this first project in Machine Learning for NLP, we had to explore what we could
do with the library Word2Vec. To do so, we extracted a dataset from the ”Wikipedia
for food products”: OpenFoodFacts.
After an extraction of the dataset at the format .csv, we had to clean the dataset
and then mainly use the ingredients columns to achieve the following goals:  
    1. Work on ingredients to vectorize them, reduce their representation to 2 dimensions
    and then create a map with them  
    2. Compare products using a similarity method and illustrate it with some examples  
    3. Create a map of products
